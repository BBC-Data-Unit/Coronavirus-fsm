In March 2020 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51944426) on the impact of closing schools on families whose children are entitled to free school meals. 

Almost 1.3 million children, about 15% of those in England's state schools, receive free school meals because they come from low income families.
